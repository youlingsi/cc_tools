  Installing Tile World for Windows

First of all, you'll want to store the files contained in this archive into
its own separate directory. If you're using the automatic installer
program, then you can do this during the installation. Otherwise, you'll
need to create a new directory for this -- something like c:\tworld -- and
extract the files there.

If you have a copy of the original chips.dat data file, you can use it with
Tile World by copying it to the data subdirectory. The shell commands would
look like this:

  cd c:\wherever\my\copy\of\chips\challenge\is\at
  copy chips.dat c:\tworld\data

If you have other data files that you would like to try out in the clone,
copy those to the sets directory instead:

  cd c:\my\collection\of\dat\files
  copy *.dat c:\tworld\sets

(The reason for using different directories is that chips.dat makes use of
configuration files. Note that you don't need to know how configuration
files work to use Tile World.)

That's all that needs to be done to set it up. Run the program as
c:\tworld\tworld, or create a shortcut for it.

Note that Tile World's user interface does not use the mouse; everything is
done with the keyboard. You can type "?" while a game is being displayed to
see a description of what the keys do. Or, you can read the instructions
found in the tworld.html.
